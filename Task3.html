    <br>
    <h3 class="center">Section 1</h3>

<h3 class="center">1.  Describe the purpose for your original multimedia/hypermedia product.</h3>

<p class="center">The purpose of my video was to communicate several things to the beginning learner in my "How to create Amazon Ads" training series. First it was to provide and introduction to the course, a basic overview, explain the purpose of the course, relate what is being communicated to the learner, explain why the information is relevant, and then to jump right into the first course which was on building a Comp List (comparable titles list) for the student's (author's) book.</br></br>

This video was meant to be a quick (under five minutes) and interesting presentation, designed to deliver information clearly and effectively.</p>

<h3 class="center">2.  Describe a target audience for the multimedia/hypermedia product.</h3>

<p class="center">The audience I'm targeting with this video is independent authors, usually between 25 to 45 years old. They are usually very busy, as independent writing is rarely a full-time occupation. It is usually coupled with another full-time job, family responsibilities, etc. With this in mind, I tried to keep the video relatively brief and fast-paced.</br></br>

My target audience is also usually made up of self-starters. These learners are often quite accustomed to finding information online and skimming quickly through it to find what they’re looking for. To that end, I’ve adopted a YouTuber-style, 1st person narrative voice, coupled with hands-on screen-shares to demonstrate first-hand how an author/learner can jump right in and start immediately emulating the skill.</p>

<h3 class="center">3.  Identify the software you chose to create the product and</br>rationalize your choice of software.</h3>

<p class="center">For story boarding I used Draw.io (www.draw.io), for filming I used QuickTime, and for video editing I used iMovie. I used Draw.io because it had a range of ready-made iconography that was clear and easy to use. It enabled me to storyboard my entire video very quickly. I used QuickTime because it allows for both webcam video capture as well as screen capture. I used both in my video. And I used iMovie for video editing because it comes stock with text-over options for highlighting particular points, such as the title of the series, or just particular points that I wanted to highlight.

<h3 class="center">4.  Discuss the process that you followed to create your</br>multimedia/hypermedia product so that someone else</br>could follow your steps to create similar products.</h3>

<p class="center">First, I referred back to my overall lesson plans from previous classes. I overviewed the bullet points for each unit, and broke them out for this first initial lesson. I then translated those into a high level script that I could use to illustrate all of the points necessary.</p>

<p class="center">After this was completed, I began storyboarding using Draw.io. This made me think through the visual ques that would be needed to illustrate each point. Some required text-overs, whereas others required screen captures to demonstrate the skill being taught in that sub-section.</p>

<p class="center">Once this was completed, I finished my script in detail. I then reviewed the script to make sure all of the points I needed to cover were addressed. I also used this time to ensure that all ARCS model requirements were woven into the script: Was I gaining students’ attention, explaining how objectives are relevant to them, instilling confidence that they are capable of learning, and establishing satisfaction in the end for a job well done. Once I was happy that all of these were satisfied, I moved on to filming.</p>

<p class="center">I filmed using QuickTime, in a combination of webcam recordings and screen recordings, according to my storyboard I’d made earlier. It took several takes, and a few re-writes, but everything eventually came together. Then came editing.</p>

<p class="center">I used iMovie to edit out the slow bits. This included gaps in the reading, pauses for breath, or simply times where I was waiting for a website transition or couldn’t think of what to say. This is extremely common in YouTube videos, and caters to the fact that my learner group values their time. I was also able to use iMovie to add text-overs to highlight certain points such as unit titles or key facts.</p>

<p class="center">When I was all finished, I exported the video to my hard drive, then uploaded it to YouTube. Then I embedded YouTube’s link into my website under Multimedia.</p>
 

<h3 class="center">Section 2</h3>

<h3 class="center">1.  Provide the conceptual framework (concept map) that helped</br>you in the design and development process.</h3>

<img class="cash" src="images/processflow.png">

<h3 class="center">2.  Discuss how your conceptual framework helped you in your design</br>and development process.</h3>

<p class="center">The conceptual framework forced me to think about many aspects of the multimedia project that I wouldn’t have considered otherwise. For one, I realized that there were aspects of each step that were going to require my talking directly to the camera (to increase interest and because there weren’t any things to show on screen), and other scenes that were going to require screen capture (to illustrate particular skills in a replicable manner).</p>

<p class="center">Using a storyboard also helped me create a logical flow for the “story” of my lesson, making sure that it fell within the ARCS model, remained entertaining, delivered all of the necessary content and wrapped up in a way that felt satisfactory and prepared the student well for the next video.</p></p></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>
